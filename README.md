# Simon Game

The Simon game is basically a game of sequence memorization. You can start the game by pressing any of the four color buttons on the screen. One of the four colour buttons will flash when the game begins. You are expected to press the button once more. Then you'll be promoted to the next level. One of the colour buttons will flash once more. In a particular level,  You must press all of the colour buttons in the same order from level one to the current level. This will continue until you press the wrong color. Have a lot of fun!
